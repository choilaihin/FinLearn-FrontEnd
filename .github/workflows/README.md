# Git Actions: Automated Build and Deployment to GitHub Pages

[View Project Git Actions](https://github.com/derekpung/FinLearn-FrontEnd/actions)

[Deployed Git Page](http://derekpung.github.io/FinLearn-FrontEnd)

## Note
Backend apis and auth are **not** set up.
Clicking on signin will attempt to redirect you to an Auth0 link that does not exist

---

## Three Key Takeaways
1. Be careful of Indentation in `.yml` file
2. `npm ci` (continuous integration) is very strict
3. GitHub Pages doesn't natively support single page applications
